This is a fake airline company's ticket booking(reservation) system, read for more info:


Variables
distance(fuel)(time of arrival) use coordinates from (google maps > Airports of Egypt)or graph it on a scale and find the distance between the pixels.
date(holidays are expensive when closing in)(first calss gets expensive especially when we have almost no seats and when near flight date, other classes get cheaper if more than 20 seats are vacant)
day(Sundays,Saturdays and mondays are more expensive)(5pm is more cheap whilst 9pm departure is  more expensive, Arrival is best at 8pm ( more expensive) instead of 11pm (more cheap)) 
class (first class, premium economy (refundable) or economy (non-refundable/cancellable))
seat (Pick seats = pay extra money)

Idea:
A program that will use the above variables to create and store  fake (but they look realistic) domestic flights through out the year (I mean times of the year will use system time and date).
You'll be able to print a flight ticket (fake flight ticket of course)
You won't really pay any money since it's fake.
A that program generates flights over fixed periods of time which could be displayed everytime you search flights, flights will update randomly causing prices to change accordingly.

Struggles:
Unable to make a useful(viewable and searchable) data base to generate (calcualte everything accordingly) / store the flights (also reserved seats in each flight must be randomized as if we had other clients).
Unable to put variables into play and get results automatically set into the database.

Suggested solutions:
Making it so user has to adminstrate own company instead of computer randomizing it totally (Seat reservation must be randomized to mimic other clients or seat reservation could ignored alltogether).
probably two seperate programs one to adminstrate the company's reservation system and the other to book the flights by the user, both would share the data base.


Background(fake):
Sohag-Arab United Airlines based in Egypt and leading a fleet of 4 A330 commercial jets to 11 destination domestically and yet soon internationally in Egypt and the middle east.
Offering competitive fare prices and upstanding high quality services for travelers to all tourist attraction spots of Egypt.
